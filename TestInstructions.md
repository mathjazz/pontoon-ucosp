# Testing Instructions

- Add issues to translation
- Remove issues from translation Search for a specific issue type & add it
- Use the search feature to search for issues
- Press `CTRL+I` to make the search box active (using arrow keys to navigate would be a great future-feature)
- Open comments
- Add a comment

### Feedback:
- Is it clear that the MQM navigation and issues are for the currently selected translation?
- Is the interface too jarring of a change for you?
- Are there any confusing elements in the UI?
- Anything else to change?
