Pontoon Prototype by Nick Delben and Joshua Nguyen

Testing Instructions:
1. Word Selection Menu:
    - Click the hamburger menu icon to expand the menu.
        - Expected behavior: the menu should slide out from the left and reveal a
            list of words to choose from
    - Click the hamburger menu again to close it
        - Expected behavior: the menu should slide back to the left, hiding itself.

2. Translation MQM Review Process:
    - Review the translation:
        - Click the review button for the translation
            - Expected behavior: a new interface should appear with options to
                assign MQM issues. The MQM Review tab should be pre-selected
        - Assigning MQM issues to the current translation by clicking through
            the MQM tree and selecting appropriate issues.
            - Expected behavior: selected issues should appear in a list just below
                the translation text
                - The count of the active issues should be reflected in the 
                    MQM Review tab heading.
        - Deselecting active issues by clicking on an orange/selected
            item in the MQM tree or by selecting an issue in the active issues list.
            - Expected behavior: the selected issue should be removed from the list
                and the style of the issue in the tree should turn to white.
        - Navigate back to main interface by clicking the "Back" button.
            - Expected behavior: the interface shoudl switch back to the main view
                - The count of active issues should be reflected in the metadata
                    area of the translation by the username and timestamp

3. User interface and user experience comments?
    - Existing unreviewed translations are considered "approved". By reviewing a
        translation, its state would be "unapproved". Is this intuitive? Should
        there be another button reserved for "approve" and another "review" button
        to access the MQM Review interface?
